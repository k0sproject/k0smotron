# Cluster API - Remote machine provider

k0smotron servers as a Cluster API provider for remote machines. A "remote machine" in this context means a machine (VM, bare metal) which can be remotely connected via SSH.

Just like any other Cluster API provider, k0smotron remote machine provider fullfils the Cluster APi contracts and thus can work with any bootstrap providers.

!!! note
    k0smotron dev team naturally focuses on testing the remote machine provider with k0s related bootstrap provider. If you see issues with any other bootstrap provider, please create issue in the Github repo.

## Using `RemoteMachine`s

To use `RemoteMachine`s in your cluster, you naturally need the top-level `Cluster` definition and control plane:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: remote-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    pods:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    serviceDomain: cluster.local
    services:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 10.128.0.0/12
  controlPlaneRef:
    apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: K0smotronControlPlane
    name: remote-test
  infrastructureRef:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: RemoteCluster
    name: remote-test
---
apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: K0smotronControlPlane
metadata:
  name: remote-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  version: v1.27.2-k0s.0
  persistence:
    type: emptyDir
  service:
    type: NodePort
```

To use `RemoteMachine` instances as part of the cluster, we need to initialize a `RemoteCluster` object. As in this use case there's really nothing we need to configure on the infrastructure, this is merely a "placeholder" object to fullfill Cluster API contracts.

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RemoteCluster
metadata:
  name: remote-test
  namespace: default
spec:
```

The bootstrap a `Machine`, we need to specify the usual Cluster API objects:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name:  remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterName: remote-test
  bootstrap:
    configRef:
      apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: K0sWorkerConfig
      name: remote-test-0
  infrastructureRef:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: RemoteMachine
    name: remote-test-0
---
apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: K0sWorkerConfig
metadata:
  name: remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  version: v1.27.2+k0s.0
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RemoteMachine
metadata:
  name: remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  address: 1.2.3.4
  port: 22
  user: root
  sshKeyRef:
    # This defines which SSH key to use for connecting to the machine. The Secret needs to have key 'value' with the SSH private key in it.
    name: footloose-key
```

## Using `RemoteMachine`s in `machineTemplate`s of higher-level objects

Objects like `K0sControlPlane` or `MachineDeployment` use `machineTemplate` to define the template for the `Machine` objects they create.
Since k0smotron remote machine provider can't create machines on its own, it works with a pool of pre-created machines.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RemoteMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: remote-test-template
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      pool: default
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: PooledRemoteMachine
metadata:
  name: remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  pool: default
  machine:
    address: 1.2.3.4
    port: 22
    user: root
    sshKeyRef:
      name: footloose-key-0
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: PooledRemoteMachine
metadata:
  name: remote-test-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  pool: default
  machine:
    address: 2.3.4.5
    port: 22
    user: root
    sshKeyRef:
      name: footloose-key-1
```

Then you can use the `RemoteMachineTemplate` in the `machineTemplate` of `K0sControlPlane`:

!!! warning "Control plane endpoint"
    When using `RemoteMachine`s for control planes, `Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint` **must** be set.

```yaml
apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: K0sControlPlane
metadata:
  name: remote-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  version: v1.27.1+k0s.0
  k0sConfigSpec:
    k0s:
      apiVersion: k0s.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
      kind: ClusterConfig
      metadata:
        name: k0s
      spec:
        api:
          extraArgs:
            anonymous-auth: "true"
  machineTemplate:
    infrastructureRef:
      apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: RemoteMachineTemplate
      name: remote-test-template
      namespace: default
---
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: remote-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  controlPlaneEndpoint: # required for K0sControlPlane
    host: 1.2.3.4
    port: 6443
  clusterNetwork:
    pods:
      cidrBlocks:
        - 192.168.0.0/16
    serviceDomain: cluster.local
    services:
      cidrBlocks:
        - 10.128.0.0/12
  controlPlaneRef:
    apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: K0sControlPlane
    name: remote-test
  infrastructureRef:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: RemoteCluster
    name: remote-test

â€¦ # other objects omitted for brevity
```

When CAPI controller creates a `RemoteMachine` from template object for the `K0sControlPlane`, k0smotron will pick one of the `PooledRemoteMachine` objects and use it's values for the `RemoteMachine` object.

### Using Sudo for Commands

When connecting to remote machines, you may need to execute commands with elevated privileges. 
The `useSudo` field allows k0smotron to wrap all executed commands with `sudo`. This is particularly useful when the SSH user doesn't have root privileges but has sudo access:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RemoteMachine
metadata:
  name: remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  address: 1.2.3.4
  port: 22
  user: my-user
  useSudo: true
  sshKeyRef:
    name: my-user-key
```

All commands executed on this machine will be prefixed with `sudo`, allowing operations that require elevated privileges.

## Cleanup

If you delete a `RemoteMachine`, k0smotron will perform cleanup of the k0s installation on the machine before deleting the object.

!!! note

    Cleanup is only performed if the `RemoteMachine` has been successfully provisioned using `K0sWorkerConfig` or `K0sControlPlane` objects.
    If the `RemoteMachine` was provisioned using some other bootstrap provider, cleanup can be performed using `customCleanUpCommands` (see below).

The cleanup process for a k0s installation includes:

- Leaving the etcd cluster (if the node is a controller)
- Stopping the k0s service
- Running `k0s reset` to clean up k0s data ([read more](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/reset/)).

## Custom Cleanup Commands

k0smotron supports executing custom commands during the machine cleanup process when a `RemoteMachine` is deleted. This feature is particularly useful for:

- Cleaning up custom installations or configurations
- Removing additional services or agents
- Performing custom data cleanup
- Handling special cleanup requirements

!!! warning
    When using `customCleanUpCommands`, you are responsible for the complete cleanup of the k0s installation. The default k0s cleanup will not be performed.

You can specify custom cleanup commands in the `customCleanUpCommands` field of a `RemoteMachine` or `PooledRemoteMachine`. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RemoteMachine
metadata:
  name: remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  address: 1.2.3.4
  port: 22
  user: root
  sshKeyRef:
    name: footloose-key
  customCleanUpCommands:
    - "systemctl stop custom-service"
    - "/custom-cleanup-script.sh"
    - "/usr/local/bin/k0s etcd leave"
    - "/usr/local/bin/k0s stop"
    - "/usr/local/bin/k0s reset"
    - "rm -rf /opt/custom-data"
    - "echo 'Custom cleanup completed'"
```

`useSudo` field will be respected for `customCleanUpCommands` to execute the commands with elevated privileges if needed.

Another way to provide custom cleanup logic is to create a script on the machine using `files` and then reference that script in `customCleanUpCommands`. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: K0sWorkerConfig
metadata:
  name: machine-test-config
  namespace: default
spec:
  version: v1.32.2+k0s.0
  files:
    - path: /custom-cleanup-script.sh
      content: |
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Running custom cleanup script"
        # Add your custom cleanup logic here
      permissions: "0755"
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RemoteMachine
metadata:
  name: remote-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  address: 1.2.3.4
  port: 22
  user: root
  sshKeyRef:
    name: footloose-key
  customCleanUpCommands:
    - "/custom-cleanup-script.sh"
```
