Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.

There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects   in any namespaces.

Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.

It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default). Format: int32 false completionMode string            completionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be `NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`.   `NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is homologous to each other.   `Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5. In addition, The Pod name takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`, the Pod hostname takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)`.   More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job. false completions integer            Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the job should be run with.  Setting to null means that the success of any pod signals the success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive value.  Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that pod signals the success of the job.

Leave `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true, the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this and other jobs to not function correctly.

Once the number of failed indexes exceeds this number the entire Job is marked as Failed and its execution is terminated. When left as null the job continues execution of all of its indexes and is marked with the `Complete` Job condition. It can only be specified when backoffLimitPerIndex is set. It can be null or up to completions. It is required and must be less than or equal to 10^4 when is completions greater than 10^5. This field is alpha-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default). Format: int32 false parallelism integer            Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should run at any given time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will be less than this number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) &lt; .spec.parallelism), i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism.

In particular, it allows to specify the set of actions and conditions which need to be satisfied to take the associated action. If empty, the default behaviour applies - the counter of failed pods, represented by the jobs's .status.failed field, is incremented and it is checked against the backoffLimit. This field cannot be used in combination with restartPolicy=OnFailure.   This field is beta-level. It can be used when the `JobPodFailurePolicy` feature gate is enabled (enabled by default). false podReplacementPolicy string            podReplacementPolicy specifies when to create replacement Pods. Possible values are: - TerminatingOrFailed means that we recreate pods   when they are terminating (has a metadata.deletionTimestamp) or failed. - Failed means to wait until a previously created Pod is fully terminated (has phase   Failed or Succeeded) before creating a replacement Pod.   When using podFailurePolicy, Failed is the the only allowed value. TerminatingOrFailed and Failed are allowed values when podFailurePolicy is not in use. This is an alpha field. Enable JobPodReplacementPolicy to be able to use this field. false selector object            A label query over pods that should match the pod count. Normally, the system sets this field for you. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors false suspend boolean            suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not. If a Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from false to true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with this Job. Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this. Suspending a Job will reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. Defaults to false. false ttlSecondsAfterFinished integer            ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set, ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted.

If the OS field is set to linux, the following fields must be unset: -securityContext.windowsOptions   If the OS field is set to windows, following fields must be unset: - spec.hostPID - spec.hostIPC - spec.hostUsers - spec.securityContext.seLinuxOptions - spec.securityContext.seccompProfile - spec.securityContext.fsGroup - spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy - spec.securityContext.sysctls - spec.shareProcessNamespace - spec.securityContext.runAsUser - spec.securityContext.runAsGroup - spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups - spec.containers[*].securityContext.seLinuxOptions - spec.containers[*].securityContext.seccompProfile - spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities - spec.containers[*].securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem - spec.containers[*].securityContext.privileged - spec.containers[*].securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation - spec.containers[*].securityContext.procMount - spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsUser - spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsGroup false overhead map[string]int or string            Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md false preemptionPolicy string            PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset. false priority integer            The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority. Format: int32 false priorityClassName string            If specified, indicates the pod's priority. \"system-node-critical\" and \"system-cluster-critical\" are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default. false readinessGates []object            If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status equal to \"True\" More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates false resourceClaims []object            ResourceClaims defines which ResourceClaims must be allocated and reserved before the Pod is allowed to start. The resources will be made available to those containers which consume them by name.   This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.   This field is immutable. false restartPolicy string            Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure, Never. In some contexts, only a subset of those values may be permitted. Default to Always. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy false runtimeClassName string            RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the \"legacy\" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class false schedulerName string            If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler. false schedulingGates []object            SchedulingGates is an opaque list of values that if specified will block scheduling the pod. If schedulingGates is not empty, the pod will stay in the SchedulingGated state and the scheduler will not attempt to schedule the pod.   SchedulingGates can only be set at pod creation time, and be removed only afterwards.   This is a beta feature enabled by the PodSchedulingReadiness feature gate. false securityContext object            SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty.  See type description for default values of each field. false serviceAccount string            DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName. Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead. false serviceAccountName string            ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/ false setHostnameAsFQDN boolean            If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Tcpip\\\\Parameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false. false shareProcessNamespace boolean            Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false. false subdomain string            If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be \"...svc.\". If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all. false terminationGracePeriodSeconds integer            Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds. Format: int64 false tolerations []object            If specified, the pod's tolerations. false topologySpreadConstraints []object            TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed. false volumes []object            List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod.

Cannot be updated. false envFrom []object            List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. false image string            Container image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets. false imagePullPolicy string            Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.

Cannot be updated. false livenessProbe object            Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes false ports []object            List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default \"0.0.0.0\" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255.

Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ false restartPolicy string            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod. This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is \"Always\". For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as \"Always\" for the init container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy \"Always\" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a \"sidecar\" container. Although this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed. false securityContext object            SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ false startupProbe object            StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes false stdin boolean            Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false. false stdinOnce boolean            Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false false terminationMessagePath string            Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated. false terminationMessagePolicy string            Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated. false tty boolean            Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false. false volumeDevices []object            volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. false volumeMounts []object            Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ false restartPolicy string            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod. This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is \"Always\". For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as \"Always\" for the init container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy \"Always\" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a \"sidecar\" container. Although this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed. false securityContext object            SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ false startupProbe object            StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false. false stdinOnce boolean            Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false false terminationMessagePath string            Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated. false terminationMessagePolicy string            Indicate how the termination message should be populated.

When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.

We consider each  as a \"bucket\", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is \"kubernetes.io/hostname\", each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\", each zone is a domain of that topology.

A constraint is considered \"Unsatisfiable\" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate \"MaxSkew\" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field. true labelSelector object            LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain. false matchLabelKeys []string            MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.   This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default). false minDomains integer            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.   For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.   This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default). Format: int32 false nodeAffinityPolicy string            NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.   If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag. false nodeTaintsPolicy string            NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.   If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.
